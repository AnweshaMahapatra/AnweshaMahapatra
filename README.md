### 👋 Hi there! I'm **Anwesha Mahapatra**

Welcome to my data world — where raw numbers transform into impactful stories and smart decisions.  

💡 My journey began with a simple question: *"What can data reveal if we just learn how to ask?"*  
Since then, I've been on a mission to uncover insights that matter.

🔍 With **2+ years of experience** as a Data Analyst, I specialize in:
- **Data wrangling & storytelling** using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Excel**
- **Building interactive dashboards** with **Power BI** and **Tableau**
- **Driving business impact** in domains like **retail**, **hospitality**, and **HR analytics**

Whether it’s optimizing product pricing, refining supply chains, or automating reports — I love turning complex datasets into meaningful, actionable visuals.
